Title: Data Analysis and Visualization: Exploring the Relationship Between COVID-19 and Happiness

Description:
This guided project aims to dive into the world of data analysis and visualization to explore the relationship between COVID-19 and happiness levels across different countries. It has three main objects:
1.	Learning the steps of preparing datasets for analysis
  a.	How to preprocess and merge datasets to make it proper for further analysis
2.	Finding a good measure as an analysis foundation
  a.	Calculating suitable measures to answer essential questions
3.	Visualizing the result of analysis and exploring the relation between variables
  a.	Representing the analysis results in the proper graph is easier for the user to comprehend.

The datasets are from a course published by Johns Hopkins University on the Coursera platform. The instructor of the guided project is Ahmad Varasteh. 
One dataset consists of data on the cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus cases per day in each country. The other dataset consists of various life factors scored by the people living in each country. These two will be merged to answer this question:
  -	Is there any relationship between the spread of the coronavirus in a country and how happy people live there?

The project structure/tasks:

Task 1: Introduction
Understand the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the questions we will answer with our analysis. 
 
Task 2: Importing the COVID-19 dataset 
Import the COVID-19 dataset and prepare it for analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
 
Task 3: Finding a good measure 
Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.
 
Task 4: Importing the World Happiness Report dataset 
Import the World Happiness Report dataset, drop useless columns, and merge it with the COVID-19 dataset to find correlations among our data.
 
Task 5: Visualizing the results 
Visualize our results using Seaborn.


NB:
This repo consists of two projects:
1. Guided project (following the instructions)

  a. Codes based on the instructions
  b. Edited code with new versions 
  
4. Practiced project (self)
